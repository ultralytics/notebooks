    "# Automatic Number Plate Recognition using Ultralytics YOLO26 + OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to implementing automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) using the YOLO26 model in combination with `gpt-4o-mini`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)?\n",
    "Automatic number plate recognition is a technology designed to identify and extract vehicle number plate information from images or videos. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of Ultralytics YOLO26 for object detection and OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` for text recognition, ANPR becomes an efficient solution for automating vehicle identification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use YOLO26 + GPT-4o-Mini for ANPR?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accurate Detection: YOLO26’s object detection capabilities ensure precise localization of license plates in various conditions, such as low light or high-speed movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Seamless Text Recognition: With `gpt-4o-mini`, extracted license plate regions are processed to recognize alphanumeric text accurately, even with variations in font, angle, or clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real-Time Processing: The integration allows for real-time vehicle monitoring, making it ideal for applications in traffic management, parking systems, and security surveillance.🚗"
